We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</li>
              <li>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the Site or the App; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</li>
            </ul>

              <li>If you become a customer of ours, we normally retain contract information (including personal data) for six years after the end of the relevant contract, or for longer where we need to do so for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, or where we are required by law to retain it for a longer period.</li>
              <li>In certain case, it may not be physically possible to delete certain data (for instance, where it is stored on a secure external server), in which case we will take appropriate steps to ensure that it is not available for re-use or disclosure to third parties.</li>
